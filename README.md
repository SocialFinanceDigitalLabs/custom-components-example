# Custom Components Example
This is a small example of creating a custom HTML component (or web component) without using any libraries or frameworks.

It will of course only work in modern browsers, so for legacy support you'll want to include a shim.

```html
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/webcomponentsjs/0.7.22/ShadowDOM.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/webcomponentsjs/0.7.22/CustomElements.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage
Just run it in your browser directly from it's file path or by starting a local web server. No compilation is required.
